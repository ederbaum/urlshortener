# urlshortener
A Url Shortener using only pure Java.

## To work locally
Please change the value of "storage.folder.path" in the file "/src/main/config/config.properties". Is necessary to point to a folder where it's possible to read and write files.
Don't forget to use at the end of the given path "/" if you are running on Unix, Mac or Linux systems, or "\\" for Windows.

If desired, also change the value of "url.root".

I tested locally using both Eclipse and Netbeans with Tomcat 9.

Running the tests will ensure that the changed settings are working.
