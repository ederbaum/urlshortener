# urlshortener

To work locally, please change the value of "storage.folder.path" in the file "/src/main/config/config.properties". It is necessary to point to a folder where it's possible to read and write files.

If desired, also change the value of "url.root".

I tested locally using both Eclipse and Netbeans with Tomcat 9.

Running the tests will ensure that the changed settings are working.
